# Diamond Price Prediction
## Introduction
Diamond is one of the strongest and the most valuable substances produced naturally as a form of
carbon. However, unlike gold and silver, determining the price of a diamond is very complex because
many features are to be considered for determining its price.
Diamond spot rates are decided twice a day based on supply and demand in diamond market. Fractional
change in diamond price may result in huge profit or loss for these investors as well as government
banks. Forecasting rise and decline in the daily diamond rates, can help investors to decide when to
buy (or sell) the commodity. Various studies have been conducted by researchers to forecast diamond
rates, each of them insightful in their own right. We in this study forecast diamond rates using by
applying various machine learning algorithms for forecasting and compare their results. This report
aims to come up with the most efficient algorithm for the price prediction of diamonds. The algorithms
such as Linear regression, Decision trees, Random Forest regression, K-Neighbors regression, and
XGBoost Regression are used to train the particular machine learning models on the diamond dataset
for the prediction of diamond prices based on various attributes.

## About Dataset
### Context
This classic dataset contains the prices and other attributes of almost 54,000 diamonds. It's a great dataset for beginners learning to work with data analysis and visualization.

### Content
price price in US dollars (\$326--\$18,823)

carat weight of the diamond (0.2--5.01)

cut quality of the cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal)

color diamond colour, from J (worst) to D (best)

clarity a measurement of how clear the diamond is (I1 (worst), SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, IF (best))

x length in mm (0--10.74)

y width in mm (0--58.9)

z depth in mm (0--31.8)

depth total depth percentage = z / mean(x, y) = 2 * z / (x + y) (43--79)
